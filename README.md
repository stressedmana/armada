# Armada

A SteamOS-like Linux distribution for ARM handhelds built on Fedora bootc using
device support from ROCKNIX.

Includes:
* ARM64 Steam
* Latest FEX
* CachyOS Proton 11
* Desktop mode (KDE)
* Bazaar App Store
* Over-the-air updates
* Install to internal storage (alongside Android)
* Power and fan control in the Steam UI
* Per-game FEX and Proton settings (Decky plugin)

> [!WARNING]
> **Prototype software. Use at your own risk.** Armada is under active
> development and is not stable. Booting it requires flashing an ABL which
> could brick your device or corrupt your Android partition.
>
> **Over-the-air updates are experimental.** Armada can now update itself in
> place (see [Updating](#updating)) instead of reflashing, but the update path
> is still being validated. If an update fails, reflashing the SD card is the
> reliable recovery.
>
> **Armada ships with a known default password.** The image ships with user
> `armada` / password `armada`. SSH is disabled by default, but if you enable it
> from Armada Control, anyone on your network can log in until you change the
> password.

The following devices are supported but their SoC has not been
thoroughly tested on Armada. There is a higher chance of brick
or Android data partition corruption on these devices until further
testing has been completed.

| Device | SoC | Status |
|---|---|---|
| KONKR Pocket FIT (G3 Gen 3) | SM8650 | ⚠️ Untested install at own risk |
| AYANEO Pocket S2 | SM8650 | ⚠️ Untested install at own risk |

## Install

Armada boots from SD card. Once it is running, you can optionally install it to
internal storage so it boots without the card (see
[Install to internal storage](#install-to-internal-storage)).

1. Flash the Armada image to SD.

   Use Balena Etcher to flash the latest `armada-YYYYMMDD.img.gz` image to a
   64GB or larger SD card (A2 speed for best results).

2. Flash the ROCKNIX ABL for your device.

   - Insert the SD card, boot into Android, and copy the `rocknix_abl` folder to
     the root of your internal storage.
   - Identify your SoC from the device table above (`SM8550`, `SM8650`, or
     `SM8750`). Flashing the wrong SoC's ABL can brick the device, so match it
     carefully.
   - Using your device's built-in "run script as root" tool, browse to your SoC's
     subfolder (e.g. `rocknix_abl/SM8550`) and run `backup_abl.sh`.
   - Copy the backup (`abl_a.img` and `abl_b.img`, written into your SoC subfolder)
     to your PC for safekeeping.
   - Run `flash_abl.sh` the same way to flash the new ABL.

3. Boot from SD and set your device model and boot mode.

   - Reboot holding VOL- to enter the ABL menu.
   - In the ABL menu (navigate with VOL-/+, select with POWER):
     - Set your device model
     - Toggle boot mode to Linux
     - Choose Start to exit

4. Wait for Steam first-run setup.

   After the intro animation, the display may be black for up to 60 seconds
   before Steam appears. This is expected on the current SD card boot path.
   Eventually you will see Steam first-run where you can configure your
   language, timezone, and Wi-Fi. At the end Steam will restart again, and
   you may see another 60 seconds of black before the login screen appears.

## Install to internal storage

Once Armada is running from the SD card, you can install it to the device's
internal storage so it boots without the card. Open **Desktop Mode** and launch
**Armada Installer** from the **System** menu.

> [!WARNING]
> Installing to internal storage repartitions internal storage and can require a
> PC (`fastboot`) to recover from a failed install. In most cases your Android
> partition will need to be resized, which will cause a **factory-reset**. 

The installer checks what is already on internal storage and offers:

- **Install alongside Android** (fresh device): choose how much storage Android
  keeps; Armada takes the rest. This **factory-resets Android** (you lose Android
  apps and data, but the Android system itself stays).
- **Reinstall / Switch to Armada** (a ROCKNIX or Armada install is already
  present): Armada replaces the existing Linux install and **leaves Android
  untouched**, with no resize or wipe.
- **Remove and restore Android**: erase the Armada/ROCKNIX install and give the
  whole disk back to Android (Android factory-resets on its next boot).

When it finishes, **power off, remove the SD card, then power on.** Internal
storage boots before the SD card.

If an install is interrupted, re-run Armada Installer from the SD card to finish.
Only if the device will not boot the SD card at all, recover from a PC with
`fastboot erase ROCKNIX`.

## Using Armada

FEX (x86 translation) and CachyOS Proton 11 are set up out of the box, so for most
games you can just install from Steam and press play, with no extra setup. The
rest of Armada works like SteamOS, and the Armada-specific controls live in
**Armada Control**, a Decky plugin in the Quick Access Menu, for tuning and the
occasional game that needs it.

### Quick Access Menu and Armada Control

Press the **Steam** button to open the Quick Access Menu (on AYANEO devices the
QAM is unmapped, so use **Home + A**), then open **Armada Control**. It has three
tabs:

- **Power.** Pick a profile: **Eco**, **Balanced**, or **Performance**. Each sets
  a fan curve, CPU underclock, and a GPU clock range. Profiles are editable in
  **Armada Control**.
- **Compatibility.** Per-game resolution and FEX settings. Pick a FEX preset
  (**Default**, **Fast**, **Compatible**, or **Custom**). The defaults work for
  most titles; change these only if a game misbehaves. Settings are saved per game.
- **Settings.** Choose the controller emulation type (**Xbox 360**, **Steam
  Deck**, or **DualSense**), launch stick and trigger **calibration**, and adjust
  system options.

### Desktop mode

From the Steam power menu, choose **Switch to Desktop** for a full KDE Plasma
desktop. The **Bazaar** app store and the **Armada Installer**
([Install to internal storage](#install-to-internal-storage)) live here. Use the
**Return to Gaming Mode** shortcut on the desktop to switch back.

### Power button and sleep

Pressing the power button does a "fake suspend" (inspired by ROCKNIX) rather than
real S3 sleep: it blanks the screen and freezes the session, and the same press
wakes it. Because the device does not truly sleep, idle battery drain is higher
than it would be with real suspend.

## Updating

> [!NOTE]
> Over-the-air updates are new and still being validated. You may need to reflash
> if an update fails.

Armada supports several release channels (only `Beta` is currently in use) and can 
update itself in place, with no reflash and no need to redownload games. Trigger an 
update from Steam's system settings. Updates are image-based with rollback, so a 
failed boot falls back to the previous image.

## Known issues

- **Black screen during Steam launch.** Sometimes there is a 30-60s black screen
  before Steam becomes fully visible, often following an update or restart.
- **Red tint.** Some devices show a red tint on the panel after Steam
  restart. It is intermittent and a reboot clears it.
- **FEX presets apply only to Proton launches.** Armada Control's per-game FEX
  preset changes are applied through the bundled Proton wrapper, so they do not
  currently affect native Linux x86 games launched directly through FEX.
- **QAM is unmapped on Ayaneo devices.** Use Home+A to open the Quick Access Menu.
